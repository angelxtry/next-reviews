        "body": "**Stardew Valley** creator Eric Barone - best known as ConcernedApe - has posted a new developer update outlining future plans for the game and briefly touching on his new project set in the same universe as the existing release. Here's what he had to say about this new title:\n\n> \"As many of you know, I’ve been working on a new game for a while. I haven’t revealed anything about it, except that it takes place in the same universe as Stardew Valley. I’ve been deliberately secretive about it because I want to be able to work on it without any pressure for the time being. I also want to make sure the concept is fully realized before revealing anything, because once it’s out there, I’m going to have to fully commit to it. I’m a pretty cautious person when it comes to this sort of thing.\"\n\nHe went on to explain how he still planned to work on new content for Stardew Valley and would be forming a team to help rollout future update for the games:\n\n> \"For a while, I considered being finished with Stardew Valley altogether. But that would make me (and many others) sad. So I’ve decided that I’m going to form a team to help me work on future Stardew Valley content. The update I’m working on right now (1.4) will be another solo update, but after that I hope to have a team in place that I can work closely with on future content.\"\n\n",

Link’s silence aside, there are quite a few fun and dramatic quotes worth remembering in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. There will be some spoilers although a majority of the story content isn’t given away.\n\n",
